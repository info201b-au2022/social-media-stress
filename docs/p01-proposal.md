#### Introduction

#### Problem Domain

#### Research Questions

1. What impact does social media have on people’s levels of stress? Through this question, we aim to find and explain the link between social media and mental health by examining indicators of stress across online communities on social media apps like Reddit. Is social media a contributing stressor, or does it help alleviate stress by allowing others to meet people with similar experiences?
2. Are people engaged in online communities geared towards sensitive topics more or less likely to experience elevated levels of stress? Many people join online communities like r/relationships or r/ptsd on Reddit to find others that have similar experiences and share their own personal experiences. Does exposure to these communities worsen stress?
3. Which online communities have an increased risk for stress, and what do they have in common? Many of the subreddits we will examine consist of people struggling with homelessness, poverty, and various forms of trauma, or are otherwise struggling with a real-world situation. How can we tell whether the stress indicators recorded are affected by social media use?

#### The Dataset

#### Expected Implications

There are many implications that can be discerned concerning the results of our research question, which aims to see the ties between social media usage and stress. Before talking about the implications, we should mention the expected results of the research question. I would expect there to be a correlation between social media and stress, whether it be social media that begets stress or social media being used as a way to vent stress.

Assuming that this ends up being the case, the primary implication for policymakers and people is that the policies in place for reducing stress and negativity at social media apps may not be sufficient. Policymakers involved in social media should know to dedicate resources to think of ways to potentially reduce this stress. Someone looking at the results of this project may be able to divert resources to either fixing social media policies that may be a source of this stress or make improvements to mental health infrastructure.

We hope the results from this research can be used to better guide and improve the experience people get on social media.
